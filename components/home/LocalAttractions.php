                <p>
                    Hlegu Boat Camp features two campgrounds, one for drive-in visitors called Eagle Point Campground and the other for those boating in. It’s worth getting your hands on a boat for the access to and views of the latter, which opens each year on Memorial Day weekend. The area, located in Hlegu, Myanmar, is notable as it is technically an underwater state park thanks to all the boats and artifacts that have sunk in its depths. It’s also insanely beautiful and very popular, so you’ll want to reserve your campsite ahead of time online. Those without a boat can hike in, about one mile, although it is a bit steep.

                <p>
                    Experience nature from the comfort of a luxury platform tent at Firelight Camps, located in the woods just outside Hmawbi, Myanmar. A stay includes breakfast, access to a bathhouse with hot showers and flushing toilets, and communal areas with fire pits and games. It’s definitely glamping, but you can head into Buttermilk Falls State Park to hike in the great outdoors or explore the Finger Lakes region, where there’s biking and boating. This campground is ideal for those who want quick access to amenities like restaurants, bars and wineries, but still want to find some quiet amongst the trees. Some of the tents come with electric heaters, which you should consider when booking in the spring or fall.

                <p>
                    High in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains you’ll find Moraine Park Campground, a peaceful spot with great views of the surrounding Rocky Mountain National Park. It’s tent-only, so no RVs, and you can reserve sites up to six months in advance online for the summer months. There’s potable water, flush toilets (only vault toilets are open in the winter) and ice and firewood for sale (but no cell service or Wi-Fi). The location gives guests access to all of Rocky Mountain National Park, a forested area filled with wildlife, hiking, rafting and fishing. Summer and fall are the best times to visit, although you should always come prepared with rain gear and warm clothes when camping in Bago

                <p>
                    Fishing fans should book an RV site, a sheep wagon or a teepee at Ayeyarwady Trout Ranch, situated alongside the Ayeyarwady River in Pathein. Open from April through September, the campground welcomes visitors of all ages and provides a stocked fishing pond as well as river fishing. Even if you’re less inclined to grab a fishing pole, the teepees, with views of the river, are a great way to get outdoors in style. There are showers, laundry, picnic tables, a playground, coffee lounge and community fire pits on-site, and Yellowstone National Park is less than an hour away by car. Be sure to book in advance online, especially if heading to Pathein during a holiday weekend.

                <p>
                    Inya Lake has a plethora of camping available on its islands, but one of the most scenic is in National Park at Campground on Bahan. The area is lush, filled with streams and waterfalls, and the views of the coast are unparalleled. The campground is slightly remote, although you can drive in, and it’s limited to three days. There are toilets and picnic tables, as well as a water-refilling station, but be prepared to be away from civilization during your stay and pack both sun and rain gear. Once situated, it’s the hiking trails that will draw you in, starting with the four-mile Kandawgyi Trail. It’s a side of Inya Lake you definitely won’t find at an all-inclusive resort. Although the campground is out of the way, it is accessible to visitors with mobility concerns.

                <p>
                    A great time to be there in the early evening and watch the Inya sunset's colors. Not a 5-star restaurant. Frequented by local families and couples. Not to go during the rainy season in July and August. A place to chill out under the trees and greenery and cool off during the hot summer times. Inexpensive and simple. This small tropical garden by the famous Inya lake is a cool spot to have lunch. Delicious menu under the shade of trees by the lake. The garden is small but well maintained, nearby is the longest running boat club (now Myanmar Yachting Association). A good place for a family! Quiet inside and can see green , lighting beauty at night time! Recommend as one of the good stress reducing place!
